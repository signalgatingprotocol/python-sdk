# SGP Python SDK

Agent-native signal orchestration for autonomous AI systems.

The Signal Gating Protocol provides composable primitives for building multi-agent systems with controlled, observable signal flow. Signals are typed, immutable events. Gates are composable predicates that control which signals pass. Agents process signals autonomously. Meshes connect agents into networks.

## Install

```bash
pip install signal-gating
```

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from signal_gating import Signal, Gate, Agent, Mesh

class TaskSignal(Signal):
    task: str

# Create agents
planner = Agent("planner")
worker = Agent("worker", gates=[Gate.by_priority(3)])

@worker.on(TaskSignal)
async def handle(signal: TaskSignal):
    print(f"Working on: {signal.task}")

# Connect in a mesh
mesh = Mesh([planner, worker])
mesh.connect(planner, worker)

async def main():
    async with mesh:
        await planner.emit(TaskSignal(task="build feature", priority=5))
        await asyncio.sleep(0.05)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Core Primitives

### Signal

Typed, immutable events that flow through the system. Subclass to define your domain:

```python
class AlertSignal(Signal):
    message: str
    severity: int = 0
```

Signals are immutable. Use `evolve()` to create modified copies:

```python
alert = AlertSignal(message="CPU spike", severity=8)
enriched = alert.with_metadata(region="us-east")
escalated = alert.evolve(severity=10)
```

### Gate

Composable predicates that control signal flow. Combine with operators:

```python
# Filter, transform, compose
high_priority = Gate.by_priority(5)
enrich = Gate.transform(lambda s: s.with_metadata(reviewed=True))
dedup = Gate.deduplicate(window=60)

# Compose with operators
pipeline = high_priority >> dedup >> enrich  # chain
either = Gate.by_type(AlertSignal) | Gate.by_priority(10)  # or
both = high_priority & Gate.filter(lambda s: s.source == "sensor")  # and
not_low = ~Gate.by_priority(1)  # invert
```

Built-in gates: `filter`, `transform`, `by_type`, `by_priority`, `rate_limit`, `deduplicate`, `retry`, `circuit_breaker`, `timeout`, `passthrough`, `block`.

### Agent

Autonomous signal processors with lifecycle management, request/response, and priority inboxes:

```python
worker = Agent("worker", gates=[Gate.by_priority(3)], priority_inbox=True)

@worker.on_start
async def setup():
    worker.state["db"] = await connect_db()

@worker.on_stop
async def cleanup():
    await worker.state["db"].close()

@worker.on(TaskSignal)
async def handle(signal: TaskSignal):
    result = await process(signal.task)
    await worker.reply(signal, ResultSignal(result=result))
```

Request/response — agents can ask questions and wait for answers:

```python
response = await planner.request(TaskSignal(task="analyze data"), timeout=5.0)
```

### Mesh

Agent network topology with gated connections and content-based routing:

```python
mesh = Mesh([coordinator, analyst, reporter])
mesh.connect(coordinator, analyst, gate=Gate.by_priority(5))
mesh.connect(analyst, reporter)

# Fan-out and fan-in
mesh.broadcast_connect(source, [a, b, c])
mesh.converge_connect([a, b, c], target)

# Content-based routing — signals go where they need to based on content
mesh.route(coordinator, [
    (lambda s: s.priority >= 8, critical_handler),
    (lambda s: isinstance(s, AnalysisTask), analyst),
], default=general_worker)

# Lifecycle
async with mesh:
    await coordinator.emit(TaskSignal(task="analyze"))
```

### Pipeline

Ordered gate chains:

```python
pipeline = Pipeline([
    Gate.by_priority(3),
    Gate.deduplicate(window=30),
    Gate.transform(enrich),
])
result = await pipeline.process(signal)
```

### Channel

Async typed conduits with backpressure and priority ordering:

```python
# Standard FIFO channel with backpressure
channel = Channel(Signal, buffer_size=100)
await channel.send(signal)        # Raises ChannelFull if full
await channel.send_wait(signal)   # Blocks until space is available

# Priority channel — highest priority dequeued first
from signal_gating import PriorityChannel
channel = PriorityChannel(Signal, buffer_size=1000)
```

### Tracing

Signal flow observability:

```python
tracer = Tracer()
tracer.record(trace_id, signal_id, "agent-a", "priority_gate", "passed")
trace = tracer.get_trace(trace_id)
print(tracer.summary())
```

## Architecture

```
Signal -> [Gate >> Gate >> Gate] -> Agent -> [Gate] -> Agent -> ...
              Pipeline                  Edge (Mesh)

Mesh: Agent --(gate)--> Agent --(gate)--> Agent
        |                                    ^
        +----------(gate)-------------------+
                   fan-out / fan-in
```
